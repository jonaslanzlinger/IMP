# pysoundlocalization Library

Welcome to the `pysoundlocalization` library! This guide will help you set up a virtual environment and install the library in editable mode so you can start working with it seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.12 or higher.

## Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment helps manage dependencies and ensures your project is isolated from other Python projects on your system.

1. **Navigate to your project directory** (where you cloned or created the `pysoundlocalization` repository):

   ```bash
   cd path/to/IMP
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install the library in editable mode**

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
